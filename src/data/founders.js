      'I work in TradFi. I spend my days building portfolios for retail to institutional clients, focused on Strategic Asset Allocation. Meaning that I think about different risk tolerances, how to build a diversified portfolio for that risk tolerance, and how to think about managing portfolios for goals. I spend a lot of time in the Cardano ecosystem, as well as Solana, Near/Aurora, Cosmos and some Polkadot. I am a tokenomics enthusiast and enjoy reading about DeFi strategies and DAO concepts. I am active community member in Optim and Minswap (along with Friktion, Dappio and others).',
